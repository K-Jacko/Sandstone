# Sandstone - 1.1

This update is a step towards using prebuilt maps and not randomly generated maps. 
I thought best to save the random generation for props and monster interactions allowing me more freedom in finding an art style to the game.

This update reworks old system and expands on them to involve final features (variables need tweaking!)

## Patch Notes :


|                                                                                    Feature                                                                                     |                 Media                  |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
|                 Combat Director<br/>The Combat director now spawns our base classes, deducting from a credit amount generated by its attached Credit Generator                 |         <img src="Rda\1.gif">          |
| Combat Director (Mutations)<br/>When spawning these mobs the Combat Director will have a chance to mutate the monster resulting in a stronger form of it being spawned instead |     <img src="Rda\2mutations.gif">     |
|                             Combat Director (Weight)<br/>The combat director will have a greater chance to spawn mutations as the game progresses                              |     <img src="Rda\3weighted.gif">      |
|         State Machines<br/>Although implemented previously they are being used properly now. Handling the movement type of enemies inside and outside of combat range          |   <img src="Rda\4StateMachines.gif">   |
|              Prop Generator<br/>Using the old grid system we now have props randomly generating, using a weighted, wallet, credit system like our combat director              |       <img src="Rda\5props.png">       |

### Honorable Mentions :
1. NavMesh implementation
2. Scene Load System 
3. MapData Serialization
4. New Readme!

## Whats Next?
Our test map and all the enemies and props look horrible! Next update ill do a quick art pass on all the assets i have now to bring the game to life a little.
